# Daily Fantasy Sports at Scale: A DraftKings Experience

---

Like so many other NFL football fans during the months of September through February, I love to participate in fantasy football. In fantasy sports, participants create a virtual team of real-life athletes and compete against other teams in a league or contest based on the statistical performance of those players in actual professional sports games. There are two ways that fantasy sports are typically played: traditional and daily. Daily fantasy differs from traditional fantasy in that it typically lasts only one day to one week, rather than the entire season. For the purposes of this user experience journal, I will focus on daily fantasy and the use of the DraftKings iPhone mobile application to play. I mostly play fantasy during the NFL season. However, since the NFL season is over for the year, I am going to enter into an NBA contest to demonstrate the experience.

My goal is to enter 20 entries into a contest called “NBA $400 Dime Time” and draft a unique team of players for each of those entries. You can see me entering the contest in the video below. I have also included a screenshot where I have circled the entry details in blue to show you some relevant information to this demonstration:

-	523/4,756 shows that there are a total of 4,756 entries allowed in this contest and 523 of them have been reserved.
-	ENTRIES (0/20) shows that I am allowed 20 entries in this contest, and I have not yet entered any lineups or reserved spots.
-	M20 in the box is saying that there is a maximum of 20 entries allowed in the contest.
